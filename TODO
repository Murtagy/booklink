Plan:
    - make a simple online-booking
        - an app for online-booking
        - an app for administration
        - a separate SSR web page for website
    - start servicing with no charge
    - make payment for notifications (integrate with rocketsms)
    - make payment for extra usage
Reasoning:
    - there seems to be strong competitors in notifications and CRM space
      yclients and online-zapis are pretty expensive, so it should be easy to gain customers through cheaper pricing
