Plan:
    - make a simple online-booking specially for autobusiness
        - an app for online-booking
        - an app for administration
        - a separate SSR web page for website
    - make payment for notifications (integrate with rocketsms)
    - make payment for extra usage
Reasoning:
    - there seems to be strong competitors in notifications and CRM space
      though those competitors are not really specialized on auto
      by more narrow marketing niche I can get some future market share

Admin app:
    register +
    login +
    create worker +
    create service +
    create schedule - create av for clicked days +
    list visits by days +
