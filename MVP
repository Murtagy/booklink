Plan:
    - make a simple online-booking
        - an app for online-booking
        - an app for administration
        - a separate SSR web page for website
    - make payment for notifications (integrate with rocketsms)
    - make payment for extra usage
Reasoning:
    - there seems to be strong competitors in notifications and CRM space
      yclients and online-zapis are pretty expensive, so it should be easy to gain customers through cheaper pricing


Admin app:
    register +
    login +
    create worker +
    create service +
    assign service to worker
    create schedule - create av for clicked days
    list visits
    add visit
    get visit info
    billing
    iframe + button
    notify
        notify customer
            at book
            before visit
        notify user
            at book
